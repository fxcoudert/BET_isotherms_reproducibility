I,899,0.001,0.05,
J,4048,0.001,0.05,
K,2634,0.001,0.025,Does not satisfy 1 BET condition (Rouquerol plot increasing)
L,716,0.01,0.2,Standard parameters (0.1-0.3) would technically work and give S = 733 m2/g
M,2240,0.05,0.2,Lower pressure has different slope but the BET assumptions are not met there
N,1121,0.002,0.05,Very sensitive to fit region. BET assumptions borderline. Fit in 0.02-0.1 range gives 1340 m2/g and could be justified
O,6105,0.02,0.15,
P,8689,0.08,0.2,Quite bad fit. BET assumptions barely hold. Would advise extreme caution with this value
Q,2737,0.05,0.22,Tempting to fit at lower range (0.001-0.05) giving S = 1627 m2/g but is not within BET assumptions there
R,1260,0.002,0.1,Standard parameters (0.1-0.3) would technically work and give S = 1541 m2/g but linearity is poor for lower pressure region
